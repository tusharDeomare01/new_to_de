## Getting Started

To get started with a Task Manager project, you'll need to set up the development environment, install the necessary dependencies, and begin building the application. Here's a basic outline of the steps to get started:


### Prerequisites

Before you start a Task Manager, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1.Development Environment: Set up a development environment on your local machine. You'll need a code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code and STS), package manager (npm).

2.Database: Choose and set up a database system to store user data, tasks, and task lists. Common choices include MySQL.

3.Frontend Framework: Select a frontend framework or library (e.g. React) for building the user interface.

4.Backend Framework: Select a backend framework or platform (e.g. SpringBoot) to run the server-side logic.

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up the development environment and get your Task Manager project started:

1.Clone the Project Repository:
git clone https://github.com/kedarganmote2000/taskMgr.git

2.Install Frontend Dependencies:
If you're using a frontend framework like React, navigate to the frontend directory and install the dependencies:
- npm i axios
- npm i bootstrap
- npm i react-router-dom

3.Install Backend Dependencies:

Navigate to the backend directory (or root directory if you don't have a separate backend) and install the backend dependencies:
- MySQL
- SpringBoot
- Spring Web
- SpringData JPA
- ModelMapper

4.Database Setup:
Setup a ID and Password of MySQL in application.properties file of SpringBoot.

5.Start the Application:
Run the frontend and backend servers. You may need to run separate commands for each servers.
- For the frontend (e.g., using React):
  npm start
- For the backend(e.g springBoot):
  run the folder as springBoot app

6.Access the Application:

Open your web browser and navigate to the URL where your application is hosted (typically http://localhost:3000 for the frontend and http://localhost:8000 for the backend if using default ports).
